# Photograph

Photograph solves the issue of generating previews or thumbnails of
web-based documents. Think of generating a preview of a Google
Spreadsheet. As a such document is dom based, it may be difficult to get a preview
that truly reflects the original content. 

Photograph solves that problem by firing a chrome instance thanks to
capybara-webkit and sinatra to provides an easy way to interface it to
your needs. 

Obviously, it supports cropping to avoid reworking the image afterward.

Please remind that having a chrome instance, even if it is being reused
by all requests is still taking some time, aroung 600ms after the first 
request on my development machine. *Consider using photograph only if
you expect the same exact rendering of your 'web documents'*.

## Installation

    gem 'photograph'

And then execute:

    $ gem install photograph

## Usage

Photograph can be used either directly through the Photograph::Artist
class or by its little sinata app.

    # => MiniMagick instance you can toy with
